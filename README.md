## âš™ Setup

NOTE: For windows 11 you'll have to recompile the bot.

1.) First download the latest version from https://github.com/kite03/AutoRoyale/releases. Install an [android emulator](https://bluestacks.com/) and get clash royale on it.

2.) Launch clash royale on the emulator and fullscreen it so the locations of everything on the screen remains consistent when you next re-run the bot.

3.) Unzip, extract and run colorfinder.exe

4.) The program will print a ton of data. The first number is the x co-ordinate, the second number is the y co-ordinate, and the third number is the color of that pixel.

5.) Now go into the "config" folder and open "config.json"

6.) Replace each item with the correct pixel location and colour as given to you by the colorfinder.exe. CARDSY SHOULD BE SET TO THE BOTTOM OF THE CARD. IT NEEDS TO UNDERCUT THE "ok" BUTTON THAT APPEARS AT THE END OF A GAME.

Pos1 should be set at the red X and Pos2 should be set at the blue X. (Troops will be placed within the green square.)
