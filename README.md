### How to use (Video guide coming soon)
1.) Install [Bluestacks](https://www.bluestacks.com/) (or any other android emulator)

2.) Launch clash royale on the emulator and fullscreen it so the locations of everything on the screen remains consistent.

3.) Download and unzip the project from releases, or compile it yourself.

4.) Run ColorFinder.

5.) Edit cfg.txt (in the config folder) so it's set up properly.

(Each line in howtosetup.txt corresponds to a line in cfg.txt)

6.) Run the bot and profit (If you're compiling it yourself make sure you're running it as release)
